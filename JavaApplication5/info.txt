You created a Wheel of Fortune project in Ch 9 in the previous Java course. 
In that version, you hard-coded the array of letters for the word the user needed to guess. 
In this version (called Hangman because it's shorter for this long project name), you will write a series of 6 words into a file which will serve as the dictionary of words for the game. 
When the project starts, that dictionary will be read into an array of words, and a random number will select which one is used in the play of the game. 
The rest of the game is the same as the project in Ch 9.

Before you begin, be sure to look at the Try It Out exercises in the additional reading in Canvas, "Reading about File Processing".

The file for this dictionary is “words.txt”, and it will contain 6 words that are input by the user. 
The words can be of different lengths. 
There need to be 6 words so there are enough to see different words chosen for the play of the game. 
You can use a larger number, but know that you have to enter all of those words at least once to get them into the dictionary. 
Six is enough to see different words chosen by random number, but not so large that entering the data becomes burdensome.
